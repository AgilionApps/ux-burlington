    <p class='lead'>
      A bunch of folks had questions about the meaning behind the butterflies on the conference badges and t-shirts. From the designer, <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickberkeley">Patrick Berkeley</a>:<br>
      Recent research has shown a gynandromorph butterfly is neither a female with male parts nor a male with female parts, but halves of two different gendered insects joined into a single body. What would living in a split gendered body be like?

This struck me: Not only do I not know how others experience things, but I haven't even conceived all the possibilities of where others' experiences begin from.

The triad of female, gynandromorph, and male butterflies is meant to provoke – or for my future, more thoughtful self, remind – me to be radically open to the experiences of others.

If I want to improve my work in user experience, I need to listen openly and believe unquestioningly others' experiences. Because I know that I do not know.
