    <h2 class='main-sub-header'>Call For Proposals, Due March 15, 2017</h2>
    <p>
      We are looking for 30 minute long talks on both technical and community topics related to User Experience. This means anything from web, mobile, and back end systems that improve UX on the web to talks about accessibility, team communication, inclusivity, and diversity, especially pertaining to the UX industry. If you need inspiration, check out <a href="https://vimeo.com/album/4035061">last year's</a> talks! 
    </p>
    <p>
    Your proposals will be anonymized in the first round of judging and will be selected by a panel of volunteers. Please refrain from using identifying information in your titles, abstracts, and notes to the panel. Please review our <a href="http://uxburlington.com/diversity/">diversity statement</a> and <a href="http://uxburlington.com/conduct/">code of conduct</a> to ensure the content of your talk is in line with our community guidelines. Submissions will close on March 15th, 2017 at 11:59:59 pm Eastern. 
    </p>
    <p>
    All speakers will receive a free ticket to the conference. We are happy to talk about helping speakers with travel and accomodation expenses, but we are a small conference so this will be needs based. Please reach out to the UX Burlington team if you have any questions: <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}"><i class='fi-mail'></i> {{site.email}}</a>
