    <h2 class='main-sub-header'>Call For Proposals, Due March 15, 2017</h2>
    <p>
      We are looking for 30 minute long talks on both technical and community topics related to User Experience. This means anything from web, mobile, and back end systems that improve UX on the web to talks about research, accessibility, team communication, and increasing inclusivity and diversity in tech. If you need inspiration, check out talks from <a href="https://vimeo.com/album/4035061" target="_blank">2016</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/album/3447854" target="_blank">2015</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Your proposals will be anonymized in the first round of judging and will be selected by a panel of volunteers. Please refrain from using identifying information in your titles, abstracts, and notes to the panel. Please review our <a href="http://uxburlington.com/diversity/" target="_blank">diversity statement</a> and <a href="http://uxburlington.com/conduct/" target="_blank">code of conduct</a> to ensure the content of your talk is in line with our community guidelines.
