If the internet is more awesome than it was in 1995, Karen would like to claim a very tiny piece of the credit. For the past 20 years Karen has helped businesses create better digital products through the power of user experience design and content strategy. She is Managing Partner at Bond Art + Science, a UX consultancy she founded in 2006, and formerly VP and National Lead for User Experience at Razorfish. Karen teaches Design Management in the MFA in Interaction Design program at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. She co-hosts A Responsive Web Design Podcast with Ethan Marcotte, and is the author of Going Responsive, published in 2015 by A Book Apart. Her first book, Content Strategy for Mobile, was published in 2012.
