Picking up a pencil or whiteboard marker can be daunting, but sketching can be one of the best tools in a designer's arsenal. Through this session, we'll review the positive impact sketching can have on the UX process. We'll work through sketching methods for different screen sizes to allow for rapid paper prototyping. We'll also review how to organize and run a collaborative sketching session with colleagues and clients.

You'll learn... how to sketch effectively; how to design and lead a collaborative sketching session; how to engage your team to draw out their ideas; and how to use paper prototypes to test quickly.
