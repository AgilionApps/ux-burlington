Designing for the enterprise is really, really hard. The reason it's hard is that in most cases the people who *buy* the software and the people who *use* the software are completely different, and therefore have completely different needs.

The people who buy enterprise software — IT managers, HR managers, etc. — care about things like configurability, control, more features than a competitor, and most of all: the ability to customize the thing *just so*, so that it fits in with whatever systems already exist. End users care about none of those things. They care about getting a job done as quickly and with as little pain as possible.

So how do you design in this kind of hostile environment? How do you provide a good end user experience while also catering to the needs of the business of selling to a different audience? That's what this talk is about. You'll learn:

* How to balance the needs of different product audiences effectively.
* How to bring user-centered design and Lean UX principles to the slow-moving machine that is the enterprise market.
* How to turn a sales-driven organization into a product-driven organization (or at least how to co-exist peacefully)

Enterprise software has never been this fun.
