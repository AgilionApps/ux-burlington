So much of our conversations towards progress focus on outcomes. What about all of the steps between ideation and launch? In the product space, so much of what we build is focused on sets of assumptions that often prove faulty.

In this talk, we'll examine the fallacies of product development and explore ways to overcome the conventional challenges that inhibit progress long before launch day by confronting our own biases and developing frameworks that enable us to better inform our teams and expand our view of our product's key audiences, stakeholders and fans.
