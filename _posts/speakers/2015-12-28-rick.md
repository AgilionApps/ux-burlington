User Experience Design in Educational Technology products can make the difference between positively engaging learners and losing them to distraction. Reading Plus, a Winooski EdTech publisher, has had great success using Agile/UX techniques to build and refine their current product suite. The results have been profound from both an instructional and an experiential perspective. Rick Cusick, CIO of Reading Plus, reviews the strategies and tactics that the Reading Plus team used, their cultural values and how they contributed to the outcomes, and what the team has learned during the course of developing this very successful EdTech product. Rick will also cover the challenges along the way, how the team responded to different needs, and what direction the team is charting moving forward.
