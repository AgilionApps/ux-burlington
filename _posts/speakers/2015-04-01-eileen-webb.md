Nothing brings UX, IA, design, and content strategy to life like launching a shiny new site: teasers fit neatly without any ellipses, images are cropped perfectly for different screen sizes, and related content is wonderfully relevant. But after a few months, things start to slip as ongoing content maintenance and creation steers the site away from its original pristine vision.

We'll explore how to improve the authoring experience for the people who are creating and maintaining content in the CMS after the site is built. We'll learn how to communicate the information needed for ongoing support of UX, structured content, information architecture, and design. Most importantly, we'll talk about how to work with our authors to create an admin experience that helps them do their jobs well.
