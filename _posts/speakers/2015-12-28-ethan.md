[Ethan Marcotte](http://ethanmarcotte.com/) is an independent designer and author, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He coined the term “[responsive web design](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design)” to describe a new way of designing for the ever-changing Web. [<cite>Responsive Web Design</cite>](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design) and [<cite>Responsive Design: Patterns and Principles</cite>](http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-design-patterns-principles), his popular books on the topic, have been widely praised, showing how designers and organizations can leverage the Web’s flexibility to design _across_ mobile, tablet, and desktop—and whatever might come next.

Over the years, Ethan has been a featured speaker at many conferences, including An Event Apart, SXSW Interactive, and Webstock. His clientele has included <cite>New York Magazine</cite>, the Sundance Film Festival, <cite>The Boston Globe</cite>, and <cite>People Magazine</cite>. He also cofounded Editorially, a collaborative writing platform.
