Evaluative research focuses on gaining a deep understanding of the lives of the end users and the contexts in which they use certain products and services. At its core, itâ€™s about challenging and exploring the problem space, before venturing into the solution space. Using real-life examples of digital tools that help people access affordable housing or register to vote, this talk will explore the different tools used for exploratory research, including ethnographic interviews, contextual inquiry, and co-creation activities and prompts. The audience will leave with a better understanding of the types of insights that exploratory research generates, and how they can complement the findings of evaluative or comparative research.
