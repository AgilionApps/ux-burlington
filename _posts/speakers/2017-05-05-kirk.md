After 30 years, and a few false starts, Virtual Reality is finally becoming mainstream. And just like the dawn of the Web, there’s a lot of bad experiences out there.  Let’s try to skip the “junk phase” in the evolution of VR and utilize some solid UX thinking in our creations.
You may have been tasked with creating a robust and amazing virtual experience.  What can you do to make it stand out from the competition?
From navigation to camera direction, I’ll explain the best practices for both interface and experience design for VR. You will learn how to identify and mitigate disorientation and improve user interaction.
I’ll also discuss how to get started with WebVR, explaining the tools and browsers, so those new experiences can be brought to a wider audience via the Web.
