Today’s most seamless customer experiences are happening across channels and touch points. Despite this emerging need, teams often focus only on the touch points and channels for which they are responsible. As a result, these teams lose sight of delivering a holistic customer experience. They miss pain points that occur when customers switch between channels. For example, think about the last time you filled your personal information into a web form, only to have a customer service representative ask you for the same information moments later over the phone. Experience mapping workshops bring teams together to discover and resolve these pain points.

This talk will show proven methods for tackling these challenges. We’ll walk through a step-by-step guide to running experience mapping workshops — you’ll get to see it in action.
