The phrase "design by committee" summons visions of bloated word processors, clumsy banking websites, and unfocused home pages. But it is possible to leverage the creativity, empathy, and domain knowledge of a group to create great designs.

This talk covers research and techniques such as priming and parallel thinking for improving group dynamics and shows how Fastly uses these techniques in our design process.
