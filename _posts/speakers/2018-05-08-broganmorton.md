While user experience is often associated with digital products and services, it is just as critical for the success of physical products. Hinesburg’s own NRG Systems has significantly improved the way it develops and over the course of this overhaul we discovered that the development process used in the physical product and digital product world are actually converging. In the end we are all trying to craft the same ‘product’; a seamless customer experience that provides them with incredible value.

The new process that has evolved combines the critical elements of design thinking, voice of the customer research, jobs-to-be-done theory and Lean Startup. Instead of simply presenting the similarities in methods and process, NRG will bring the audience along a development journey using an actual product that is still in development.
