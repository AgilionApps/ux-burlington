Perceive, operate, understand, and be robust: these are the principals of accessibility online. In the near future, it is expected that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) will roll out official compliance guidelines concerning website accessibility as part of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). But even without finalized guidelines, costly litigations have already determined a precedent regarding online accessibility - just ask Harvard University, Target, and the NBA.

As designers, marketers, and executives, it is important to regularly review our websites to ensure that the content and features are digestible and provide the same reasonable level of accessibility as do your physical locations. This presentation will review ADA compliance guidelines, how to implement them across several roles, and showcase examples of award-winning user experiences that are WCAG Compliant.
