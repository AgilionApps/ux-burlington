In 1983, Michael Crichton wrote a screenplay about a graduate student who uses genetic research to clone dinosaurs... but you've never seen this movie. Crichton knew the narrative didn't work. What university would actually fund research for dinosaur cloning?

A better setting? A theme park. Kids love theme parks, so Crichton's Jurassic Park iteration two told the story of a theme park filled with cloned dinosaurs... from the view of a child.

You get the point. Sometimes ideas are just bad, in stories and in code. This talk is about recognizing bad ideas and turning them into good ones.
