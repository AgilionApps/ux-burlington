### About Katie

I am a User Experience (UX) Designer and Researcher focusing on healthcare. I love to help simplify the complex, work on big problems, and collaborate with tightly-knit teams. I use design, visualization, and empathy to empower patients and improve the healthcare experience.

I have played key roles in diverse design projects that included a mobile application to encourage walking, a crime visualization tool, a responsive website for medical professionals, the redesign of a large call center support website, a mobile application to help IT administrators manage their enterprise virtual machine infrastructure, and a major customer support system redesign.
